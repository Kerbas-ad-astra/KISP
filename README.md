#KISP: KAA Integrated Space Plan - A Vision of the Future of Kerbalkind

In 1989, Ronald Jones of Rockwell International (manufacturer of the Space Shuttle orbiter, among other things) made a giant flowchart called the **Integrated Space Plan**.  The original has been scanned in high-definition [**here on Makezine**](http://makezine.com/2012/09/13/the-rockwell-international-integrated-space-plan/), converted into a vector file by [**a reader of that site**](http://makezine.com/2013/07/06/the-rockwell-integrated-space-plan-vector-redux-version/), updated in 2015 into [**a slick website**](https://integratedspaceanalytics.com/cms/plan), and here's some [**BBC commentary**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/22513815) and [**a Wired article**](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/wildly-detailed-100-year-plan-getting-humans-mars/) on it.  It basically laid out, on one chart, the visions of all of the world's aerospace agencies and companies, on a path from the Space Shuttle in the 1980's to the beginning of "Human expansion into the cosmos" in 2100.  It is extremely optimistic, proposing that we would have multiple permanent bases in LEO and on the Moon by now (2015), lunar tourism by the end of this decade, and terraforming Venus and Mars starting in the mid-21st century (e.g. "Create new moons for Mars if required", ca. 2040), among other ambitious projects (though, given the success of the LADEE probe's laser communication demonstrator, we may get the "Advanced laser comm network" a couple of decades earlier than Jones thought we would).  It's the kind of optimism and ambition that drives my interest in aerospace engineering, and I think that it's what drives a lot of what we do in Kerbal Space Program, so I wanted to make an Integrated Space Plan illustrating my ultimate plans for spreading Kerbalkind throughout their solar system (and beyond).

I haven't come close to achieving every goal yet (I've only launched a couple of probes into interplanetary space), but I'm working on it.  Presenting the KAA Integrated Space Plan!

It comes in two forms.  The first, vertically oriented, is what I call the "planets-in-sequence" approach, in which each planet's infrastructure is built up one after the other.  The other, "planets-in-parallel", involves each planet's infrastructure being built up as soon as it is technologically feasible (launch windows and funding permitting, of course).  Those of us who like to juggle a bunch of missions at once might find the parallel approach more familiar, though the sequential chart is more compact (and looks more like the original Integrated Space Plan to my eyes).

##Essential Addons

Some of the nodes are only meaningful (or become more meaningful) if certain addons are installed:

* [**AntennaRange**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440) to justify building communication networks.
	* [**AntennaRange Relays**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129704) by yours truly (and its dependency, [**Contract Configurator**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)) is recommended, to get some extra funds to make the relays happen.
* [**Community Tech Tree**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) to give some of these mods' parts proper nodes of their own to live in.
* [**Extraplanetary Launchpads**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545) for off-world manufacturing.
* [**Home-Grown Rockets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60974) for 1.875m ("Size 1.5") parts, great for launching interplanetary probes, crewed moon flybys, and small land-and-return missions while staying light.  It really helps to smooth out the jump from Size 1 to Size 2.
	* [**Filter Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231) is recommended to give these parts (and lots of other wacky cross-sections as well, contributed by yours truly :)) proper icons and descriptions in the "Filter by Cross-Section" category.
* [**Hooligan Labs**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961) for inflatable airships (handy for Eve or Laythe exploration -- or Kerbin exploration, for that matter).
* [**SCANSat**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) for planetary mapping functionality.
* The [**Umbra Space Industries family**](https://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/) for [**sounding rockets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102502), [**colony parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588), [**enhanced ISRU**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401) and asteroid mining, [**exploration**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86695) parts, [**life support**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116790), [**survival bits**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84359), and advanced [**fusion**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93054) and [**warp**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798) engines.

##Recommended Addons

Other addons that I use which fit nicely in this plan:

* [**ADEPT**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98178) (with [**dependency-removing and node-fixing patch**]( http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98178-NASA-Adaptable-Deployable-Entry-Placement-Technology-%28ADEPT%29-by-OLDD-%2826-04-14%29?p=1972624&viewfull=1#post1972624) to work in 1.0.4, with or without Deadly Reentry) and [**MonkeyWrench**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99235) for heavy reusable (i.e. non-ablative) heat-shield parts.
	* MonkeyWrench's parts are likely going to be revised extensively, so be careful before using them, but the KIS configs (updated by yours truly) are pretty handy, and are available directly from [**the MonkeyWrench repository**](https://github.com/WarrenSchultz/MonkeyWrench).
* [**Asteroid Day**](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/232196-asteroid-day) for asteroid-hunting infrastructure and large probe parts.
* [**Atomic Age**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855) and [**Nuclear Rockets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135061) (almost part of the USI family, still in development) for advanced nuclear engines and [**Cryogenic Engines**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766) for advanced chemical engines.
* The **Bahamuto Dynamics family**, for cool stuff like [**the Critter Crawler and retractable rocket engines**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82341) and [**heavy-duty landing gear**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660).  There's also a set of [**docking parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49035), including shielded Size 2 docking ports, but mind the node orientations with that one.
	* If you're getting the retractable rocket engines, you might also spring for [**XT Landertrons**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61294) to get a set of Soyuz-like braking engines.  (Be sure to grab [**the fixed DLL**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/XanderTek_XTLandertron/releases) by yours truly.)
* [**Civilian Population**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124162) to allow colonies to be populated without having to bring new colonists aaaallll the way from Kerbin (handy for settling other planets, and for setting up Kerbinoid vs. Spacenoid conflicts -- feel free to use [**BD Armory**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209) to act out said conflicts, but that's beyond the scope of the Integrated Space Plan).
	* [**Deep Freeze Continued**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124720) to let those colonists who do come aaaallll the way from Kerbin get to their destination without having to eat along the way.
	* **Field Experience** (from [**Magico13's Modlets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663)) so that your explorers don't have to go aaaallll the way *back to* Kerbin to gain the benefits of experience.
* [**DDS4KSP**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672) by Lilleman, to crush old mods into less memory.  :)
* [**Discreet Parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273) for collapsible airplanes and airships that can be carried inside or launched on top of rockets.
* [**DMagic Orbital Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972), [**Impact!**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087), [**KDEX**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54656), [**Mark One Laboratory Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104677), [**Munar Surface Experiments Package**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86247) (with [**KIS update patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86247-1-0-2-Munar-Surfaces-Experiment-package-%28Phase-4-update-now-available%21-MSEP-now-uses-KIS%21%29?p=2183427&viewfull=1#post2183427)), [**Solar Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111678), [**Starwaster's Probe Science Patches**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56137), and [**Tarsier Space Technologies**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111157) for MOAR SCIENCE!  Gotta unlock all of those new nodes somehow.
	* [**Field Research**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123892) and [**ScienceAlert**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76793) to help grab new science.
* [**ESLD Jump Beacons**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91582) for in-system warp jumps.  When I get to this technology stage, I'll see if it's advantageous over the Alcubierre drive for any reason.
* [**Extraplanetary Launchpads Extended**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89774) for workshops in the USI MKS and OKS form factors.
* [**Kerbal Attachment System**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514) and [**Kerbal Inventory System**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111) for in-situ assembly, transfer, and repair options (I've saved several missions with them).
	* [**Infernal Robotics**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707) (with [**replacement models and expansion packs**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123950)) for more articulation and in-situ assembly options.
	* [**Universal Storage**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75129) and [**Multipurpose Express Pallet System**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92684) (with [**my thermal and sorting patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92684-v0-25-MEPS-Multipurpose-Express-Pallet-System-v0-2-1-Cargo-Bay-Flooring-27-10?p=1958045&viewfull=1#post1958045)) for more storage and transfer options.
	* [**OSE Workshop**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234) for in-situ part production.

* The **NecroBones family** for super-heavy launchers ([**SpaceY**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408) and [**SpaceY Expanded**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133301)), big lander parts ([**Lithobrake Exploration Technology**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517)), standardized fairings ([**Zero-Point Inline Fairings**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94427)), and filling a few stock gaps and supplying other nifty parts ([**Modular Rocket Systems**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067)).
	* If you're using stock aerodynamics, you'll need [**AnimatedDecouplers**](https://github.com/Starwaster/AnimatedDecouplers) to let ZPIF and the MRS LAS shroud protect stuff.  For ZPIF, you'll also need [**my patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94427-1-0-4-REVIVED-Zero-Point-Inline-Fairings-v1-0-1-%282015-06-09%29?p=2012212&viewfull=1#post2012212) until the next release.
	* Also Dr. Jet's [**Chop Shop**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517) for more lander and rover parts.
	* Also **ASET** [**Portable Rover Components**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86343) (be sure to grab the [**KIS update patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86343-Portable-Rover-Components-New-project-from-ASET-%28up-29-07-14%29?p=2099629&viewfull=1#post2099629)) and [**Deployable Light Globes**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50531) (and [**KIS update patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50531-Sunshine-movie-style-Deployable-Light-Globe-%28updated-25-10-2013%29?p=2184129&viewfull=1#post2184129) and [**Vanguard Technologies Plugin**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305)) for more surface exploration parts.

* [**OpenGL**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84203) to be able to use all of these addons at once (I use them all and then some, though I have had to switch from Astronomer's Visual Pack to KSPRC and move several mods that used to be on this list into the new "Former Recommendations" category below between 0.25 and 1.0.4).
* [**Planetary Base Systems**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413) for more collapsible base parts.

* **Universal Docking Ports** from [**Kip Engineering**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73005) (with toadicus's [**AdaptiveDockingNode plugin**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79128)) for universal space tugs and refueling stations.

###Former Recommendations

Addons which I don't use anymore (mostly because of memory limits -- the game may load with them installed, but won't play for very long), but do fit in this plan:

* [**Active Texture Management**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005) as an alternative to converting DDS's manually -- since most of the mods I use are already converted, I don't use ATM personally anymore (it's easy enough for me to just crunch the few non-DDS textures remaining with Lilleman's utility), but it's still a viable tool.
* The **ASET family**, for landers ([**ALCOR**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925)) and rovers ([**ERS**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947)). [**Konquest**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79880) will have more cool colonization bits when it gets completed.
	* Keep an eye on [**CxAerospace**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92523) as well; it doesn't have any heat shielding ability yet, but it will, and it will have other cool colonization bits when it's finished.
* [**BoxSat**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91616), for small satellite parts and easy in-field assembly.
* [**Firespitter**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551) for early-game airplane parts (e.g. propellers, landing gear).  *(Obviously, I kept the plugin.)*
* [**Hangar**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933) for keeping utility vehicles on-base without turning the game into "Space Slideshow Simulator 2011".  *(This one's going through beta testing for 1.0.2, so be careful.)*
* [**Lack Luster Labs**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102237) for more cool spacecraft parts (especially for long-range cruisers), and [**Stock Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542) for more gap-filling.  *(I've kept the Mk3 ramp and the inline goo cannister, but nothing else.)*
	* Also Logan Darklighter's [**Eagle and Karbonite adaptations**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24906-LLL-Lack-Luster-Labs-Dev-Thread-LLL-13-1-13DEC2014-SXT-19-07DEC2014-KSC-v3?p=1713210&viewfull=1#post1713210) (Karbonite bits only work on 0.25, though).
* Nertea's [**Near Future Technologies**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042) for more mid-to-late-ish deep-space propulsion options, [**Stockalike Station Parts Expansion**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814) for some cool space station parts, and [**Mk. IV Spaceplane System**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699) for large cargo spaceplanes.
	* Also K. Yeon's [**OPT Space Plane Parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525) for...guess what.
* [**Orbital Material Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81578) (which has an [**unofficial 1.0.4 build**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118716)) and [**Station Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774) for more science and more reasons to make space stations.
* [**Pathfinder**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122484) for smaller "seed" colonies and exploration.
* [**Taurus HCV**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75074) for heavy crewed vessels.
* [**TAC-LS**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667) *(not removed for memory, but replaced by USI-LS)*.
	* [**Cargo Transfer Bags**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70986) and [**HexCans**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33754) have some nice storage parts for TAC-LS resources.

###Alternate Suggestions

Addons which I haven't used (or don't use on my main install), but probably would fit nicely in this plan:

* [**B9 Aerospace**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630) (with [**interim 1.0.4 update**](https://bitbucket.org/blowfishpro/b9-aerospace/)) for heavy spaceplanes and spacecraft.
* [**Behemoth Aerospace Engineering**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124064) for what I can only describe as ultra-heavy launchers.
* [**CactEye Orbital Telescope**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105660) for more asteroid-hunting infrastructure.
* [**Deep Space Exploration Vessels**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88604) for mid- to late-game colonization parts.
* [**Interstellar (Extended)**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159) for more end-game options.
* [**KW Rocketry**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037) and [**NovaPunch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/3870) for heavy rockets.
* [**Parameciumkid's Jump Drive**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66921) instead of or in addition to ESLD.
* [**RemoteTech**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305) or [**RemoteTech XF**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108669) as an alternative to AntennaRange.
* [**Snacks!**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841) instead of TAC-LS or USI-LS, and the [**USI EZ-Snack Oven**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92309) (may not work with 1.0.x) to close the loop.  Are there any other life support systems that have ISRU support?
* [**WarpShip**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120454) for advanced space exploration vessel parts and spacedocks.

##Changelog

* 2015 Feb 06 -- Initial release.
* 2015 Sep 08 -- Version 1.1.
	* Updated chart to include size 1.5 vehicles.
	* Updated mod suggestions for 1.0.4.

##Roadmap

I may refine or rearrange the plan over time, especially as I achieve more of the goals and get a better idea of what steps are prerequisites for what, but it probably won't change drastically.  I might make a "KISP Chronicles" mission report series depicting my efforts as well.

In the long run, I'm kind of interested in making an addon out of it.  It could be a roadmap that can be seen in-game, highlighting which steps have been achieved and suggesting technologies to help achieve the next steps.  I've seen that some people like to play science mode, but struggle to seek inspiration for further missions once they've mastered flight, docking, inter-body transfer, and landing in the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system; a chart like this, I think, would give them a good vision of what's possible, as well as a concrete path to achieving it.

There are also a few very minor gaps in the space plan that aren't covered by the above list of mods.  I'm working on making those myself...stay tuned!

##Challenge

Note that I call this the *KAA* Integrated Space Plan for a reason -- it's very dependent on the technology tree and addons that I use, and my priorities.  This is my plan.  What's yours?
