KISP: KAA Integrated Space Plan - A Vision of the Future of Kerbalkind

In 1989, Ronald Jones of Rockwell International (manufacturer of the Space Shuttle orbiter, among other things) made a giant flowchart called the Integrated Space Plan (the original has been scanned in high-definition here on Makezine, and also converted into a vector file by a reader of that site, and here's some BBC commentary on it).  It basically laid out, on one chart, the visions of all of the world's aerospace agencies and companies, on a path from the Space Shuttle in the 1980's to the beginning of "Human expansion into the cosmos" in 2100.  It is extremely optimistic, proposing that we would have multiple permanent bases in LEO and on the Moon by now (2015), lunar tourism by the end of this decade, and terraforming Venus and Mars by the mid-21st century (e.g. "Create new moons for Mars if required", ca. 2040), among other ambitious projects (though, given the success of the LADEE probe's laser communication demonstrator, we may get the "Advanced laser comm network" a few decades earlier than Jones thought we would).  It's the kind of optimism and ambition that drives my interest in aerospace engineering, and I think that it's what drives a lot of what we do in Kerbal Space Program ("Send a nuclear-powered Hype Train to Ike?  Sure!" https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2qtnxv/i_accidentally_built_a_hype_train_for_a_2m/ ), so I wanted to make an Integrated Space Plan illustrating my ultimate plans for spreading Kerbalkind throughout their solar system (and beyond).

I haven't come close to achieving every goal yet (I've only launched a couple of probes into interplanetary space), but I'm working on it.  Presenting the KAA Integrated Space Plan!



It comes in two forms.  The first, vertically oriented, is what I call the "planets-in-sequence" approach, in which each planet's infrastructure is built up one after the other.  The other, "planets-in-parallel", involves each planet's infrastructure being built up as soon as it is technologically feasible (launch windows and funding permitting, of course).  Those of us who like to juggle a bunch of missions at once might find the parallel approach more familiar, though the sequential chart is more compact (and looks more like the original Integrated Space Plan to my eyes).

Some of the nodes are only meaningful (or become more meaningful) if certain addons are installed.  I started working on this in 0.25 (in fact, I haven't started using part mods on my 0.90 install at all), so not all of these mods are fully compatible with 0.90 -- I've marked the ones that I know aren't quite up-to-date yet.  The addons which are "essential" to the KAA Integrated Space Plan are:

* AntennaRange to justify building communication networks.
* CactEye Orbital Telescope for asteroid hunting infrastructure.  (This one didn't receive a full update in 0.25, so I haven't actually used this plugin at all yet.)
* Community Tech Tree (and TechManager), to give some of these mods' parts proper nodes of their own to live in.
* Custom Biomes -- not required for 0.90, but for 0.25.
* Deadly Reentry for heat shields and a reason to use them (or wait for 1.0 for stock reentry heating).
* Extraplanetary Launchpads for off-world manufacturing.
* Hooligan Labs for inflatable airships (handy for Eve or Laythe exploration -- or Kerbin exploration, for that matter).  Sounding Rockets also has something like this, but I haven't tried them out myself.
* SCANSat for planetary mapping functionality.
* Station Science for more reasons to make research space stations (and early-game docking ports).
* TAC-LS for...life support, and for another reason to use ISRU.
* The USI family for sounding rockets, colony parts, ISRU (though this is becoming stock as well) and asteroid mining, exploration and survival bits, and advanced warp and fusion drives.

Other addons that I use (or will be using) which fit nicely in this plan:

* Active Texture Management to allow the use of all of these mods.  :wink:  (Between this and OpenGL, I have most of these addons loading at once on my 0.25 install, with Environmental Visual Enhancements and Astronomer's Visual Pack on top of that, but this required a fair amount of configuration tweaking on my part.  I don't know if I could load all of these in my current 0.90 install, or if I'd have to run KSP-64 on Linux, or keep a  "parts install" and a "screenshots install".  There's more stuff in the stock game now; many of these addons have gained parts; Fuel Tanks Plus, KMPI, and MoarKerbals didn't exist yet; and CactEye was in a much less stable state.)
* ADEPT (with dependency-removing configuration http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98178-NASA-Adaptable-Deployable-Entry-Placement-Technology-%28ADEPT%29-by-OLDD-%2826-04-14%29?p=1636923&viewfull=1#post1636923 to work in 0.90) and MonkeyWrench for heavy heat-shield parts.  Keep an eye on CxAerospace as well; it doesn't have any heat shielding ability yet, but it will, and it will have other cool colonization bits when it's finished.
	* Also the Bahamuto Dynamics family, for shielded Size 2 docking ports (and other cool stuff, like the Critter Crawler and the spotlight, heavy-duty landing gear, retractable rocket engines, etc.).  (Most of these should work in 0.90, but be careful.)
* The ASET family, for landers (ALCOR), rovers (PRC and ERS), and lighting parts (Deployable Light Globes and Inline Lights).  (You'll want to grab the 0.90 interim compatibility updates for RPM and JSIPartUtilities.)  "Konquest" will have more cool colonization bits, if/when it gets completed.
	* Also AviationLights and SurfaceLights.
	* Also, keep an eye on HABOne for more slick-looking colonization bits (when it's done).
* BoxSat and NanoKube for small satellites.
* ESLD Jump Beacons for in-system warp jumps (be sure to grab the 0.90 recompile).  When I get to this technology stage, I'll see if it's advantageous over the Alcubierre drive for any reason.
* Firespitter for early-level airplane parts (e.g. propellers, landing gear).  (Make sure you get an up-to-date DLL from either an up-to-date mod that redistributes it, e.g. Kolonization, or from the "Download plugin" link on Snjo's website.)
	* Kerbonov for more early- and mid-level airplane parts (especially for smaller vehicles).
* Hangar for keeping utility vehicles on-base without turning the game into "Space Slideshow Simulator 2011". 
* KASA for advanced space exploration vessel parts and spacedocks.  (Be sure to grab the appropriate vessel for Interstellar or stock.)
* Kerbal Attachment System for in-situ assembly, transfer, and repair options (KAS has saved more than one of my missions).
	* Infernal Robotics (with replacement models and expansion packs) for more articulation and in-situ assembly options.
	* Universal Storage, Cargo Transfer Bags, HexCans, and Multipurpose Express Pallet System for more storage and transfer options.
* Kerbal Foundries and KMPI/Mobile Frame System for heavy-duty ground vehicle parts.
* Kip Engineering Universal Docking Ports for universal space tugs and refueling stations.
* Lack Luster Labs for more cool spacecraft parts (especially for long-range cruisers), and Stock Extension for more gap-filling.
	* Also Logan Darklighter's Eagle and Karbonite adaptations (Karbonite bits only work on 0.25, though).
* MoarKerbals to allow colonies to be populated without having to bring new colonists aaaallll the way from Kerbin (handy for settling other planets, and for setting up Kerbinoid vs. Spacenoid conflicts -- feel free to use BD Armory to act out said conflicts, but that's beyond the scope of the Integrated Space Plan).
* Multipurpose Colony Modules for smaller "seed" colonies.
* The NecroBones family for heavy launchers (SpaceY), fairings (Zero-Point Inline Fairings), and filling a few stock gaps and supplying other nifty parts (e.g. docking ports with integrated alignment lights) (Modular Rocket Systems and Fuel Tanks Plus).
	* Also Taurus HCV for heavy crewed vessels.
	* Also (or instead) RLA Stockalike for filling gaps, and Procedural Fairings for...fairings.  Or wait around until 1.0 to get stock fairings.
* Nertea's Near Future Technologies, Stockalike Station Parts Expansion, and Mk. IV Spaceplane System.
	* Also (or instead) K. Yeon's OPT Space Plane Parts for...guess what...and Hex Trusses for more space-station parts.
* Netherdyne Mass Drivers for more reusable launch systems (handy for launching resources from moon mines to orbital or planetary manufacturing plants).
* Orbital Material Science, Fuel Science, DMagic Orbital Science, KDEX, RoverScience, and Starwaster's Science Patches for MOAR SCIENCE!  Gotta unlock all of those new nodes somehow.
* Socke's 1.875m parts for medium-sized rockets that carry two Kerbals only (once the 2-kerbal pod is released -- handy for rockets that are carried to and return from other places) or launching large/long-distance probes.

Even with all of these things, there are still a few gaps left to be filled, but I'm working on those.

Addons which I don't use, but probably would fit nicely in this plan:

* B9 Aerospace for heavy spaceplanes and spacecraft.
	* Thus FAR, which is also good for giving you a reason to use fairings (or wait around for aerodynamic improvements in 1.0).  (I've got FAR on my 0.25 install, but not B9, and neither of them on 0.90, which is why I've put it here.)
* Interstellar for more end-game options, though I don't know how well it cooperates with...anything else, really, as I've heard it does funky things with the science and resource systems.  I've seen an 0.90 port, a CTT adaptation, and a Near Future adaptation...is Regolith compatibility on the list, or is it naturally compatible by virtue of using the Community Resource Pack?
* KW Rocketry for heavy rockets.
* Other alternate tech trees, like Mod-Oriented Tech Tree or ADIOS, but probably not BTSM (FlowerChild says BTSM is meant to be played alone...KISP is not).
* Outer Planets, StarSystems, and the like, for more places to explore.
* Rabidninjawombat's EPL->Regolith conversion instead of Kolonization.  (I have both Kolonization and this mod's predecessor, an EPL->Karbonite conversion, on my 0.25 install, because EPL integration was only made part of Kolonization in the 0.90 update.)
* RemoteTech or RemoteTech XF as an alternative to AntennaRange.
* Snacks! instead of TAC-LS, as there's a USI "snack oven" part.  Are there any other life support systems that allow the "loop" to be closed with ISRU?
* Parameciumkid's jump drive system instead of or in addition to ESLD.

Roadmap:

I might refine or rearrange the plan over time, especially as I achieve more of the goals and get a better idea of what steps are prerequisites for what, but it probably won't change drastically.  I might make a "KISP Chronicles" series depicting my efforts, if anyone's interested -- though if this happens anytime soon, it will mostly be happening on my 0.25 install (as I'm not tired of stock 0.90 yet), so it won't be showing off the full power of some of the recent updates to these addons (or to the stock game, for that matter).

In the long run, I'm kind of interested in making an addon out of it.  It could be a roadmap that can be seen in-game, highlighting which steps have been achieved and suggesting technologies to help achieve the next steps.  I've seen that some people like to play science mode, but struggle to seek inspiration for further missions once they've mastered flight, docking, inter-body transfer, and landing in the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system; a chart like this, I think, would give them a good vision of what's possible, as well as a concrete path to achieving it.

There are also a few very minor gaps in the space plan that aren't covered by the above list of mods.  I'm working on making those myself...stay tuned!

Challenge:

Note that I call this the *KAA* Integrated Space Plan for a reason -- it's very dependent on the technology tree and addons that I use, and my priorities.  This is my plan.  What's yours?
