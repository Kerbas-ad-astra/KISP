#KISP: KAA Integrated Space Plan - A Vision of the Future of Kerbalkind

In 1989, Ronald Jones of Rockwell International (manufacturer of the Space Shuttle orbiter, among other things) made a giant flowchart called the **Integrated Space Plan**.  The original has been scanned in high-definition [**here on Makezine**](http://makezine.com/2012/09/13/the-rockwell-international-integrated-space-plan/), converted into a vector file by [**a reader of that site**](http://makezine.com/2013/07/06/the-rockwell-integrated-space-plan-vector-redux-version/), updated in 2015 into [**a slick website**](https://integratedspaceanalytics.com/cms/plan), and here's some [**BBC commentary**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/22513815) and [**a Wired article**](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/wildly-detailed-100-year-plan-getting-humans-mars/) on it.  It basically laid out, on one chart, the visions of all of the world's aerospace agencies and companies, on a path from the Space Shuttle in the 1980's to the beginning of "Human expansion into the cosmos" in 2100.  It is extremely optimistic, proposing that we would have multiple permanent bases in LEO and on the Moon by now (2015), lunar tourism by the end of this decade, and terraforming Venus and Mars starting in the mid-21st century (e.g. "Create new moons for Mars if required", ca. 2040), among other ambitious projects (though, given the success of the LADEE probe's laser communication demonstrator, we may get the "Advanced laser comm network" a couple of decades earlier than Jones thought we would).  It's the kind of optimism and ambition that drives my interest in aerospace engineering, and I think that it's what drives a lot of what we do in Kerbal Space Program, so I wanted to make an Integrated Space Plan illustrating my ultimate plans for spreading Kerbalkind throughout their solar system (and beyond).

I haven't come close to achieving every goal yet (I've only launched a couple of probes into interplanetary space), but I'm working on it.  Presenting the KAA Integrated Space Plan!

It comes in two forms.  The first, vertically oriented, is what I call the "planets-in-sequence" approach, in which each planet's infrastructure is built up one after the other.  The other, "planets-in-parallel", involves each planet's infrastructure being built up as soon as it is technologically feasible (launch windows and funding permitting, of course).  Those of us who like to juggle a bunch of missions at once might find the parallel approach more familiar, though the sequential chart is more compact (and looks more like the original Integrated Space Plan to my eyes).

(I've put them both in spoiler blocks, since they're huge images.)

##Essential Addons

Some of the nodes are only meaningful (or become more meaningful) if certain addons are installed:

* [**AntennaRange**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440) to justify building communication networks.
	* [**AntennaRange Relays**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129704) by yours truly (and its dependency, [**Contract Configurator**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)) is recommended, to get some extra funds to make the relays happen.
* [**Community Tech Tree**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385) to give some of these mods' parts proper nodes of their own to live in.
* [**Extraplanetary Launchpads**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545) for off-world manufacturing.
* [**Home-Grown Rockets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60974) for 1.875m ("Size 1.5") parts, great for launching interplanetary probes, crewed moon flybys, and small land-and-return missions while staying light.  It really helps to smooth out the jump from Size 1 to Size 2.
	* [**HGR Community Fixes**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/131556-104-5-hgr-community-fixes-home-grown-fixes-for-home-grown-rockets-v12-2016-mar-01/) by yours truly will bring HGR up-to-date for 1.1.
	* [**Filter Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231) is recommended to give these parts (and lots of other wacky cross-sections as well, contributed by yours truly :)) proper icons and descriptions in the "Filter by Cross-Section" category.
* [**SCANSat**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) for planetary mapping functionality.
* The [**Umbra Space Industries family**](https://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/) for [**sounding rockets**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102502), [**colony parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588), [**enhanced ISRU**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401) and [**asteroid mining**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/82809-105-asteroid-recycling-technologies-v070-20151208/), [**exploration**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86695) parts, [**life support**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116790), [**survival bits**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84359), and advanced [**fusion**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93054) and [**warp**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798) engines.
	* LouisB3 has produced [**USILS patches**](https://github.com/LouisB3/USILS-Patches) for the mods below which add habitation parts.

###Extra Recommendations

I used to use these with 0.25, then I stopped during 1.0.x for memory reasons, and now that 1.1 brings Unity 5 and 64-bit executables, I'm using them again (and EVE and Ven's Stock Revamp).  They're cool, but be advised that many of them take up lots of memory (>100 MB each in some cases) and are largely duplicated by several mods listed above.

* Angel125's [**Mark One Laboratory Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104677) for early-game science and 1.875m parts, and [**Pathfinder**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121397-110-beta-pathfinder-0924-space-camping-geoscience/#post2207773) and [**Buffalo**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122617-105-buffalo-nasa-inspired-msev-fly-like-jetman-yves-rossy-with-the-jetwing/) for smaller "seed" colonies and exploration.
* [**BoxSat**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91616), for small satellite parts and easy in-field assembly.
* [**ESLD Jump Beacons**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91582) for planet-to-planet warp jumps.

* K. Yeon's [**OPT Space Plane Parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525) (with [**community 1.1.x releases](http://spacedock.info/mod/711/Orbit_Portal_Technology_OPT_Spaceplane_Parts)) for more large spaceplane parts.
* Nertea's [**Near Future Technologies**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042) and [**Kerbal Atomics**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130503-10511-kerbal-atomics-fancy-nuclear-engines-initial-11-test/) for more mid-to-late-ish deep-space propulsion options, [**Stockalike Station Parts Expansion**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814) for some cool space station parts, [**Mk. IV Spaceplane System**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699) for massive cargo spaceplanes, [**Heat Control**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112027-11-heat-control-more-radiators-updated-18042016-basic-11-release/) for nuclear reactor and ISRU cooling, and [**Cryogenic Engines**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766) for advanced chemical engines.
* [**Orbital Material Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81578) (which has an [**unofficial 1.1 build**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118716)) and [**Station Science**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774) for more science and more reasons to make space stations.
* [**Planetary Base Systems**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413) for collapsible base parts in an alternative form factor.
	* DStaal has [**some patches**](https://github.com/DanStaal/DStaal_UKS_KPBS_Addons) to improve UKS integration.
* [**QuizTech Aero Pack**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111691) (with [**continuation**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/145635-113-quiztech-aero-pack-continued/)) for some later-game airplane parts.
* Eskandare's [**Thermonuclear Turbines**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136788-11-eskandare-heavy-industries-thermonuclear-turbines-1011/) for some *slick-sounding* nuclear jets.

###Former Recommendations

Addons which I don't use anymore (mostly because they've fallen out of date with the massive overhaul of 1.1, or I've grown away from them), but do fit in this plan:

* The **ASET family**, for landers ([**ALCOR**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925)), rovers ([**ERS**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947) and [**Portable Rover Components**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86343) with [**KIS update patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/77943-portable-rover-components-new-project-from-aset-up-290714/&do=findComment&comment=1999507)) and [**Deployable Light Globes**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50531) (and [**KIS update patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/46461-quotsunshinequot-movie-style-deployable-light-globe-updated-25102013/&do=findComment&comment=1966180) and [**Vanguard Technologies Plugin**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305)). [**Konquest**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79880) will have more cool colonization bits when it gets completed.
	* Keep an eye on [**CxAerospace**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92523) as well; it doesn't have any heat shielding ability yet, but it will, and it will have other cool colonization bits when it's finished.
* BahamutoD's [**Adjustable Landing Gear**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660) for flexibility in designing aircraft.  They've also got motors, which is great for taxiing to survey waypoints with landed aircraft!
	* BahamutoD made some other cool stuff, like [**the Critter Crawler and retractable rocket engines**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82341) (be sure you're using the BDAnimationModules.dll from Adjustable Landing Gear) and a set of [**docking parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49035), including shielded Size 2 docking ports, but mind the node orientations with that one.  If you're going to use the Mk1-2 propulsion skirt, be sure to grab [**my hotfix patch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/45157-wip-bahamuto-dynamics-dockable-fairings-11513/&do=findComment&comment=2224882).
* Dr. Jet's [**Chop Shop**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76248-105-dr-jets-chop-shop-v0801-10122015/) for more lander and rover parts.
* [**Civilian Population**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124162) (with [**revival**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143823-113-newbier-newbs-revamp-of-civilian-population/)) to allow colonies to be populated without having to bring new colonists aaaallll the way from Kerbin (handy for settling other planets, and for setting up Kerbinoid vs. Spacenoid conflicts -- feel free to use [**BD Armory**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209) to act out said conflicts, but that's beyond the scope of the Integrated Space Plan).
* [**Firespitter**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551) for early-game airplane parts (e.g. propellers, landing gear).  *(Obviously, I kept the plugin.)*
* [**Hangar**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933) for keeping utility vehicles on-base without turning the game into "Space Slideshow Simulator 2011".  *(This one's going through beta testing for 1.0.x, so be careful.)*
* [**Hooligan Labs**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961) for inflatable airships (handy for Eve or Laythe exploration -- or Kerbin exploration, for that matter).
	* [**Discreet Parts**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123273) for collapsible airplanes and airships that can be carried inside or launched on top of rockets.  *(In 1.0.5, I used this instead of Hooligan Labs -- keeping the HL DLL only.)*
* [**Kerbal Foundries**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84102) for cool tank treads and hover parts.
* [**Lack Luster Labs**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102237) for more cool spacecraft parts (especially for long-range cruisers), and [**Stock Extension**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542) for more gap-filling.  *(I've kept the Mk3 ramp, the inline goo cannister, and the size 0 fairing and heat shield.)*
	* Also Logan Darklighter's [**Eagle and Karbonite adaptations**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22926-lll-lack-luster-labs-development-thread/&do=findComment&comment=1698303) (Karbonite bits only work on 0.25, though).
* [**TAC-LS**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667) for a life support system grounded in reality (and a lot less forgiving).
	* [**Cargo Transfer Bags**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70986) and [**HexCans**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33754) have some nice storage parts for TAC-LS resources.
* [**Zero-Point Inline Fairings**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94427) by NecroBones.  If you're going to use this with stock aero, you'll need [**AnimatedDecouplers**](https://github.com/Starwaster/AnimatedDecouplers).

###Alternate Suggestions

Addons which I haven't used (or don't use on my main install), but probably would fit nicely in this plan:

* Angel-125's [**Deep Space Exploration Vessels**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88604) for mid- to late-game space exploration parts.
* [**B9 Aerospace**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630) (with [**ongoing community updates**](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9-Aerospace/releases)) for heavy spaceplanes and spacecraft.
* [**Behemoth Aerospace Engineering**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124064) for what I can only describe as ultra-heavy launchers.
* [**CactEye Orbital Telescope**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105660) for more asteroid-hunting infrastructure.
* [**Dynamic Texture Loader**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128660-1051-0-dec-25-2015-dynamic-texture-loader/), from the maker of ATM, to unload part textures until you're actually using the part in question.
* [**Parameciumkid's Jump Drive**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66921) for in-system warp jumps.
* [**Extraplanetary Launchpads Extended**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89774) for workshops in the USI MKS and OKS form factors (but following EL's resource processing sequence).
* [**Interstellar (Extended)**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159) for more end-game options.
* [**KW Rocketry**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037) and [**NovaPunch**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/3870) for heavy rockets.
* [**RemoteTech**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139167-113-remotetech-v171-2016-07-02/) as an alternative to AntennaRange.
* [**WarpShip**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120454) for advanced space exploration vessel parts and spacedocks.

##Changelog

* 2015 Feb 06 -- Initial release.
* 2015 Sep 08 -- Version 1.1.
	* Updated chart to include size 1.5 vehicles.
	* Updated mod suggestions for 1.0.4.
* 2016 Mar 21 -- Updated mod suggestions for 1.0.5.
* 2016 Apr 28 -- Updated mod suggestions for 1.1.

##Roadmap

I may refine or rearrange the plan over time, especially as I achieve more of the goals and get a better idea of what steps are prerequisites for what, but it probably won't change drastically.  I might make a "KISP Chronicles" mission report series depicting my efforts as well.

Now that KSP 1.1 has the KSPedia system, I might be able to make a KISP chart that can be viewed in-game...

There are also a few very minor gaps in the space plan that aren't covered by the above list of mods.  I'm working on making those myself...stay tuned!

##Challenge

Note that I call this the *KAA* Integrated Space Plan for a reason -- it's very dependent on the technology tree and addons that I use, and my priorities.  This is my plan.  What's yours?
